âœ… T1: Learn About Regression and Classification Models
In supervised learning, there are two main types of problems: Regression and Classification.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Regression Models
Goal: Predict a continuous numerical value.

ðŸ“Œ Examples:
Predicting house prices.

Forecasting temperature.

Estimating sales or revenue.

ðŸ“˜ Common Algorithms:
Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

2. Classification Models
Goal: Predict a category or class label.

 Examples:
Email classification: spam or not spam

Disease prediction: positive or negative

Image classification: cat, dog, car, etc.

 Common Algorithms:
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
